    description: `
      <p>Built comprehensive QA tooling for Apple that accelerated asset integration by validating models, textures, and metadata before they entered the pipeline.</p>
      
      <h4>Background & Reasoning</h4>
      <p>Our asset pipeline processed thousands of 3D models from both internal teams and external vendors. Quality issues with these assets frequently caused pipeline failures, wasting valuable time and resources. We needed automated tools to catch problems early.</p>
      
      <h4>Implementation</h4>
      <p>I developed a suite of asset validation tools that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Automatically validated geometry for common issues like non-manifold edges, inverted normals, and bad UVs</li>
        <li>Verified textures for correct dimensions, formats, and compression settings</li>
        <li>Cross-checked metadata against our database schema to ensure completeness</li>
        <li>Generated automatic thumbnails for visual verification</li>
        <li>Created LODs when required using our standardized algorithms</li>
        <li>Provided detailed error reports with specific remediation steps</li>
        <li>Integrated with our asset management system for seamless workflow</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Impact</h4>
      <p>These QA tools dramatically improved our pipeline efficiency:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduced asset integration failures by 85%</li>
        <li>Decreased turnaround time for fixing asset issues from days to hours</li>
        <li>Standardized quality across all assets, regardless of source</li>
        <li>Enabled scaling our asset production by 3x without increasing QA headcount</li>
        <li>Provided better feedback to external vendors, improving their first-time submission quality</li>

    title: "LOD Generation Pipeline",
    description: `
      <p>Integrated a proprietary LOD generation algorithm into Sledgehammer Games' asset pipeline for Call of Duty WWII, replacing manually authored LODs with automatically generated ones that preserved visual fidelity while drastically reducing polygon counts.</p>
      
      <h4>Background & Reasoning</h4>
      <p>Creating multiple levels of detail (LODs) for the thousands of assets in Call of Duty WWII was a massive undertaking that consumed significant artist resources. The manual process was inconsistent and often resulted in LODs that either lost too much detail or didn't reduce polygon counts enough.</p>
      
      <h4>Implementation</h4>
      <p>I integrated and customized a proprietary mesh simplification algorithm into our pipeline that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Analyzed each model to identify visually important features that needed preservation</li>
        <li>Generated multiple LOD levels automatically with appropriate polygon reduction ratios</li>
        <li>Maintained silhouette edges and high-detail regions based on visual importance</li>
        <li>Preserved UV mapping and material boundaries</li>
        <li>Integrated seamlessly with our existing asset processing pipeline</li>
        <li>Allowed for artist overrides when necessary for specific assets</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Impact</h4>
      <p>The automated LOD system transformed our asset production process:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduced LOD creation time from hours to minutes per asset</li>
        <li>Freed up approximately 30% of environment artist time for more creative tasks</li>
        <li>Improved overall performance by enabling more aggressive LOD strategies</li>
        <li>Resulted in more consistent visual quality across LOD transitions</li>
        <li>Enabled rapid iteration on environments without manually redoing LODs</li>

    description: `
      <p>Created an optimization tool that identifies and removes unnecessary edges in 3D models, significantly reducing polygon counts without affecting visual quality.</p>
      
      <h4>Background & Reasoning</h4>
      <p>During the modeling process, artists often create additional edges for construction purposes that don't contribute to the final visual appearance. These unnecessary edges increase polygon counts and processing overhead without adding value to the final asset.</p>
      
      <h4>Implementation</h4>
      <p>I developed a Maya tool using Python that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Analyzes mesh topology to identify redundant edges that don't affect silhouette or surface curvature</li>
        <li>Uses advanced algorithms to determine the visual impact of removing each edge</li>
        <li>Provides a preview mode to visualize before/after results</li>
        <li>Offers adjustable thresholds for controlling optimization aggressiveness</li>
        <li>Maintains UV mapping and material boundaries during optimization</li>
        <li>Can be run in batch mode for processing multiple assets</li>
        <li>Generates detailed logs of changes made to each model</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Impact</h4>
      <p>The Edge Cleanup Tool delivered impressive results:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduced polygon counts by 15-30% on average with no visible quality loss</li>
        <li>Improved runtime performance, especially on models used in background scenes</li>
        <li>Saved artists hours of tedious manual cleanup work</li>
        <li>Standardized optimization levels across all assets</li>
